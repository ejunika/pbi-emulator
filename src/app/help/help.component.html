  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
    This is an emulator to test the embeded report of Power BI. Here you can test the embed report with or without
    apply the RLS (Row Level Security).
  </p>
  <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
  <p>
    For security resions we are not handling the user Authentication & Authorization process. There for you need to
    have a client, which can login to Power BI and get you back the Azure Access Token. I'll recoment <strong>Postman</strong>
    for Authentication steps.
  </p>
  <h2>How to use the emulator?</h2>
  <p>
    For getting started with the emulator follow the steps mentioned below.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Login to the Power BI using <strong>Postman</strong> and get the <strong>access token</strong></li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Manage Token</strong> menu, provide the access token and save it</li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Manage Account</strong> menu, provide the <strong>username</strong> and save it</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    And now you are ready to go.
