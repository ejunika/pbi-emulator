  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
    This is an emulator to test the embedded report of Power BI. Here you can test the embed report with or without
    applying the RLS (Row Level Security).
  </p>
  <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
  <p>
    For security reasons, we are not handling user Authentication, and so you need to have a client, which can log in to
    Power BI and get you back the Azure Access Token. <strong>Postman</strong> is the recommended client for
    Authentication steps.
  </p>
  <h2>How to use the emulator?</h2>
  <p>
    For getting started with the emulator follow the steps mentioned below.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Log in to the Power BI using Postman and get the access token and you are ready to use this application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the access token to log in to the application.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a successful login, you will be redirected to the home page of the application.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    And now you are ready to go.
